<h1> Welcome, to the website I created to teach others how to do the same... </h1>
<h2> This website is an atempt to teach my understanding of website coding and design... </h2>  
    <h3> how to get started with brackets</h3>
    <h4> (steps to use brakets) </h4>
    <div class="something">
   <ol>
       <li> make sure you have brakets downloaded on your device.</li>
       <li>open it, <em>to be sure it works.</em></li>
       <li> leave <en> Brackets</en> and open files on your device.</li>
       <li> create a folder, name it what you want, (<em> I am not going to tell you how to live your life</em>) </li>
    <li> make sure the file has the right .________, for instance: <strong>.html, .mp4, etc..</strong></li>
       <li> start the document.</li>
       <li> first type <strong>  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong></li>
       <img src="">
       <li> then <strong>&lt;html&gt; </strong> a copy of that should apear next to that or below that, don't erase it, or else you will need to type it in again later. <em> (and that would just be a waste of time) </em></li>
    <li> then <strong>&lt;html&gt; </strong>, again do not erase the one that apears with it. Also, make sure the <strong>&lt;html&gt; </strong>tags are inside the &lt;html&gt; tags. </li>
    <li> then you need a <strong> title!</strong> for that you should use a <strong> &lt;h1&gt; </strong>tag, and like all the other tags, another one will apaer, and like all other tags do not erase it. </li>
    <li> with the <strong>&lt;h1&gt; </strong>tag, there are many others, the only difference is that the font size becomes smaller. to do that replace the 1 with 2 or, 3 or, 4 or, 5 or, 6... all that changes is the font size. </li>
